this tool has been made to automate displacement exported from zbrush/mudbox and Texturing XYZ displacement map setup in maya


for arnold, renderman and vray.
the setup is based on Akin Bilgic's displacement workflow article

FOR MAYA 2017 and above.


Install:
This tool is module based, you can place the "XYZ Displacement Tool" folder anywhere.

Launch maya, drag'n'drop "install.mel" into your viewport, a new icon will be created in current shelf

Instructions for Renderman : 
before you start using the tool, you must convert your maps into tex files with renderman's texture manager then pick the converted tex Files.

due to Renderman's nature you will have to re-launch the IPR to see any difference when you change the blender values
